# Creating blog posts <Badge type="tip" text="v1.0.6" />

This guide covers the essentials of creating blog posts.

## ðŸ“† Creating a post

Create a new ``.md`` file at ``blogger/public/posts``. Name it whatever you want.

::: tip

The post ``slug`` sub url will be named whatever you name the ``.md`` file.

It is recommended to name your ``.md`` file to: ``DD-MM-YYYY-YOUR-BLOG-POST-TITLE.md``.

Next, paste the example structure for your post and edit to your liking:

```md

title: "Blog post title"
date: "20-05-2025"
last_updated: "25/05/2025"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
desc: "Blog post description"
header: "/path/to/header.png"
read_time: "10min"
author: "Author name"

Save your post file and refresh to view the changes on your blog! It should dynamically update by itself.
